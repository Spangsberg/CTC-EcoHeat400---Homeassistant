# CTC-EcoHeat400---Homeassistant
This is a fork of @Kasper-73's repository, all credit to him for doing the hard work. (Ogiginal: https://github.com/kasper-73/CTC-GSi-8---Homeassistant) 

I updated his script with a couple of small fixes, and adapted it to run on an ESP-12F_Relay_X2 board. This adds the option to utilize the EcoHeat Smart A and Smart B inputs, that enable a lot of power saving featurs. I only wonder why CTC hides these features so well.....


For connection between CTC EcoHeat and Homeassistant (testet with CTC EcoHeat 412).
I haven't found all the modbus registers yet from the lists in the pdf files

I added a Dallas temperature sensor as well, connected to GPIO2

Using Esphome it is possible to read and write modbus.
